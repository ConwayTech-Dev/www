  "extra": "A nice update that brings some cool new features and fixes!\n\nWe are also exited to announce that we moved into <a href=\"https://floss.social/@zenbrowser\">floss.social</a>!\n\nIn response to recent privacy concerns, we've significantly strengthened Zen's privacy measures. Previously, we only disabled telemetry, but some minimal pings were still being sent. Now, firefox telemetry has been completely stripped out from the core.\n\nAdditionally, onboarding pages and intial essentials favicons are now served through our own fully private CDN and our website no longer relies on any external services/CDNs. Initial essentials selected on startup will only be loaded once clicked on the tab as well.\n\nOnly essential security updates and other non-telemetry-related services remain. As a result, the number of external connections has dropped from 82 to around 13 â€” factoring in that Zen's site is loaded twice (for the welcome page and privacy policy) and about 10 favicons are fetched from our private CDN.\n\nThis will take effect since <a href=\"https://github.com/zen-browser/desktop/actions/runs/14696034782\">this build</a>. Please let us know if you experience any issues!\n\nPsst. With the release of firefox 138, folders are just around the corner!",
